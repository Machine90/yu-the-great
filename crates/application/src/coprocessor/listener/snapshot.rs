/// how to do snapshot and transfer backups from leader

/// coprocessor driver, and it's methods will be called
/// when leader found some voter in state Snapshot, and
/// decide to send snapshot to it.
///
/// ### Snapshot & Backups
/// **Snapshots** are a practical way to manage versioning
/// and create light, easily accessible data. They donâ€™t
/// need a lot of storage space or time to create copies.
///
/// **Backups** are unique copies of a directory
/// that are stored on a different, often external, location.
/// These are large-scale performances that are done
/// periodically as protection in case of server failure
/// or data loss.
///
/// ### Toolkits
/// There has some toolkits help to implement `SnapshotListener` more easier.
/// * [FileSnapshot](crate::coprocessor::listener::snapshot::file_snapshot::FileSnapshot): 
/// An implementation of file type-based backups transfer
/// * [BinSnapshot](crate::coprocessor::listener::snapshot::bin_snapshot): 
/// An implementation of binary content type-based backups transfer
/// 
/// ### Usages
/// ```rust
/// // Step1: define your backup files handler.
/// pub struct FileHandler;
/// 
/// impl BackupSender for FileHandler {
/// 
///     // Step2: let me known if you have some things to send.
///     fn prepare_backups(&self, ctx: &RaftContext, _: &SnapshotMetadata) -> PathBuf {
///         // place your backup stuffs under "./send"
///         Path::new("./").join("send").to_path_buf()
///     }
/// }
/// 
/// impl ReceiveHandler<File> for FileHandler {
///     // Step3: as a receiver, I'll only receive what I need.
///     fn exists(&self, item: &MetaInfo) -> bool {
///         let path = Path::new(item.identify.as_str());
///         let fname = path.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap();
///         let to_restore = Path::new("./").join("receive").join(fname);
///         to_restore.exists()
///     }
/// 
///     // Step4: open a file instance of `item` for writting, 
///     // there maybe has multi items 
///     fn open_writer(&self, item: &MetaInfo) -> std::io::Result<File> {
///         let path = Path::new(item.identify.as_str());
///         let fname = path.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap();
///         let restore = Path::new("./").join("receive");
///         let f = OpenOptions::new()
///             .create(true)
///             .write(true)
///             .open(restore.join(fname))?;
///         Ok(f)
///     }
/// }
/// 
/// // Step5: then register your handler as "file snapshot handler"
/// let listener = FileSnapshot::new(1, FileHandler, FileHandler);
/// 
/// // Step6: then this listener can be registered to coprocessor driver
/// driver.add_listener(Listener::Snapshot(Arc::new(listener)));
